								<h2>My Background</h2>
								<p>My interest in IT is a more ‘general’ interest both hardware and software. It sparked from a really young age when I got my first computer with windows XP and was fascinated at how it worked, and spent hours trying to figure it out. At the moment my IT experience is just a “family tech support” where is fix my family’s technology issues and setup their new devices. I chose to come to RMIT for a majority of reasons, friends that have attended RMIT have said it’s an excellent university epically for its technology courses and many of my high school friends have chosen to also attend RMIT this year. My high school Hume Central Secondary College is also a SNAP school, so we have attended many RMIT events where they have talked about what they offer and the benefits they provide to us which has convinced me to choose RMIT. The location of RMIT is also very convenient with a just a train ride to Melbourne central and a short walk. What I expect to learn in my studies in Information Technology is practical industry skills that are in demand not only today but in the future. Skills such as Database design, programming, understand users, hardware, and mobile application development is what I expect to learn. The skills I learn in RMIT I want to be able to apply to either my job (company/freelancing) or just personal use in developing programs/applications. </p>
								<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
								<p>The position of my ideal job is a programmer, I found one on seek which I think would suit me its for a company called Attra. The position involves planning and development of programs for the finance/banking and payment industry. This position is appealing to me because of the programming aspect of it, where you plan projects and develop them in teams. The position requires an experienced individual which I am not yet, and therefore it is something I need to work towards, the position requires 5+ Years of experience, experience in HTML, CSS, CoffeScript, AngularJS/2 and many more. The skills/experience that I currently have are minimal I do have a qualification in retail management (Certificate 3) and customer service experience (3 years) at McDonalds. The way I plan to obtain the skills and experience is to first after graduating find a post graduate programming job, one that requires no experience. That way I can build my experience over the years and with it my skills through using methods such as online training/courses for the minor skills eg new programming language.</p>

								<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
								<p>The quizzes I did demonstrate the way I function, the way is learn is auditory, the way I process situations is that im controlling. For me they help me understand why I do things differently eg when I want to read I book I would listen to the audiobook instead. Or in an intense situation I would take a leadership role and assign people to different tasks. These results should be taken into account when forming a team because I would want people with other results and not the same so that It would not only keep things interesting but be a learning opportunity for how others learn/react.</p>
