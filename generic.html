								<h2>My Background</h2>
								<p>My interest in IT is a more ‘general’ interest both hardware and software. It sparked from a really young age when I got my first computer with windows XP and was fascinated at how it worked, and spent hours trying to figure it out. At the moment my IT experience is just a “family tech support” where is fix my family’s technology issues and setup their new devices. I chose to come to RMIT for a majority of reasons, friends that have attended RMIT have said it’s an excellent university epically for its technology courses and many of my high school friends have chosen to also attend RMIT this year. My high school Hume Central Secondary College is also a SNAP school, so we have attended many RMIT events where they have talked about what they offer and the benefits they provide to us which has convinced me to choose RMIT. The location of RMIT is also very convenient with a just a train ride to Melbourne central and a short walk. What I expect to learn in my studies in Information Technology is practical industry skills that are in demand not only today but in the future. Skills such as Database design, programming, understand users, hardware, and mobile application development is what I expect to learn. The skills I learn in RMIT I want to be able to apply to either my job (company/freelancing) or just personal use in developing programs/applications. </p>
								<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
								<p>The position of my ideal job is a programmer, I found one on seek which I think would suit me its for a company called Attra. The position involves planning and development of programs for the finance/banking and payment industry. This position is appealing to me because of the programming aspect of it, where you plan projects and develop them in teams. The position requires an experienced individual which I am not yet, and therefore it is something I need to work towards, the position requires 5+ Years of experience, experience in HTML, CSS, CoffeScript, AngularJS/2 and many more. The skills/experience that I currently have are minimal I do have a qualification in retail management (Certificate 3) and customer service experience (3 years) at McDonalds. The way I plan to obtain the skills and experience is to first after graduating find a post graduate programming job, one that requires no experience. That way I can build my experience over the years and with it my skills through using methods such as online training/courses for the minor skills eg new programming language.</p>

								<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
								<p>The quizzes I did demonstrate the way I function, the way is learn is auditory, the way I process situations is that im controlling. For me they help me understand why I do things differently eg when I want to read I book I would listen to the audiobook instead. Or in an intense situation I would take a leadership role and assign people to different tasks. These results should be taken into account when forming a team because I would want people with other results and not the same so that It would not only keep things interesting but be a learning opportunity for how others learn/react.</p>
								<h2>Project Plan</h2>
								<p>My project that I would like to develop is a smartphone app that tracks all of the users paid subscriptions. When an individual subscribes to services such as Netflix, vpn’s, newspapers sometimes they forget that they are subscribed and so they are automatically paying a monthly bill without even knowing. This app aims to solve that. The app will be written in Java as that what we are currently learning, for IOS and android mobile phones and potentially even desktops.
</p>
									A survey conducted showed that more than 70% of users forget to cancel their recurring subscription bill and end up paying for it. And interestingly 29% did not know that it was recurring and that could be a feature for my app, a monthly reminder that theres going to be recurring charges. (Source: http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/hiatus-survey-62-consumers-waste-money-on-unwanted-subscriptions-because-they-dont-cancel-2107639.htm)
</p>
									The way my app would work is that after a user has subscribed to a service (we will use Netflix as an example) they can enter in the details of the subscription eg Name of service, Start date, bill type (recurring or not), price, total cost for a year. After they enter the details into the app, the app will automatically remind them when the recurring charge will incur 1 days prior to give them time to either cancel or keep the service, and will also keep track of how much the user has and is spending on the service to give them a good idea of how they’re managing their money.
</p>
									For this project we will only need just a piece of software and hardware. For the software since we will be coding in java we need the latest version of eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org) and a phone, ill be using my personal phone (iPhone XS) and if needed to test on android can use a emulated phone in eclipse.
</p>
									The skills required would be programming knowledge which would be the hardest tool to obtain since we already have the hardware, we are doing a programming subject which makes it easier but for the more advanced things we might have to consult the CSIT mentors and or the tutors.
</p>
									If this program is successful it will achieve its goal of informing users on when their subscriptions are about to incur a monthly charge reminding them of it to save them money, and as I previously mentioned this is a real problem and one that I have experienced many times, a lot of people are losing money from it and this will definitely help.
