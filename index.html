										<h2>Project Plan</h2>
										<p>My project that I would like to develop is a smartphone app that tracks all of the users paid subscriptions. When an individual subscribes to services such as Netflix, vpn’s, newspapers sometimes they forget that they are subscribed and so they are automatically paying a monthly bill without even knowing. This app aims to solve that. The app will be written in Java as that what we are currently learning, for IOS and android mobile phones and potentially even desktops.</p>
